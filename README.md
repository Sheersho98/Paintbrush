**The add product feature for artists is unavailable on the live version due the mySQL database on the cloud not taking in image files properly. Hosting on a different platform may resolve this issue. </br>

Paintbrush is an e-commerce website made for independent artists to sell their artwork as prints and for users to be able to browse and purchase them. </br>
Users can sign up for the site as either regular users or as artists. If signed in as an artist, they can upload their artwork by adding it as a "product." Here they
can set the price of their product or artwork (on a per print basis). They can also edit and/or delete products. They will also be able to view the status of their 
incoming orders. They can change the status of the order based on what stage the order is in (from "Pending" to "Accept Order," "Delivered Order," and "Decline Order").
Regular users meanwhile can browse through the artwork available and search for anything specific they are lookin for (by name). They can then place order and even specify
the quantity of prints they want. They can also choose to cancel their order through the "Order History" tab. 

The purpose and vision behind the website was to allow local artists to gain exposure through a centralized market-place, where people could freely browse through the work produced
by talented individuals.
